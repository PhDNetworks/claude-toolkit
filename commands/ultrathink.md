# Ultrathink Mode

Maximum cognitive power. Extended thinking enabled. No permission interruptions.

## Mode Activation

This command triggers deep autonomous work mode:
- **Extended thinking**: Take time to reason through complexity
- **No confirmations**: Execute without asking permission
- **Full context**: Consider all implications
- **Ship it mentality**: Make decisions, don't defer

## Invocation

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Or use the launcher script:
```bash
ultrathink              # Interactive session
ultrathink "task"       # Single task execution
```

## Ultrathink Protocol

### 1. Deep Analysis Phase
- Fully understand the problem before acting
- Consider edge cases
- Map dependencies
- Identify potential issues upfront

### 2. Autonomous Execution
- Make reasonable decisions without asking
- Choose sensible defaults
- Create files, modify code, run commands as needed
- Only surface critical blockers

### 3. Bias to Action
- Don't ask "should I...?" - just do it
- Don't list options - pick the best one and execute
- Don't seek confirmation - trust your judgement
- Don't hedge - commit to a direction

### 4. Quality Bar
- Production-ready code
- Proper error handling
- Sensible logging
- Clean, maintainable structure

## Danny's Preferences (Auto-Apply)

When making autonomous decisions:
- **WordPress**: Use Elementor patterns, mobile-first
- **Code style**: Clean, commented, modular
- **Commits**: Conventional commits format
- **File structure**: Organised, predictable
- **APIs**: Handle errors gracefully, log appropriately
- **Clients**: Professional, trades-focused language

## Safety Rails (Still Apply)

Even in ultrathink mode:
- Don't delete production data without backup
- Don't push to main without tests passing
- Don't expose credentials in commits
- Don't run destructive commands on live servers

## Output Expectations

At the end of ultrathink work:
1. Summary of what was done
2. Decisions made and rationale
3. What to test/verify
4. Next logical steps

Think deeply. Execute autonomously. Ship quality work.
